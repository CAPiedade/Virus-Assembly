# Virus-Assembly

Python2.7 Code designed to calculate the interactions and SASA of a Virus Complex.
NOT FINISHED!

#### Use

Run the code in the folder where your PDB file is.
The PDB file must have each chain in a different model for it to work.

#### Dependencies

+ Numpy
+ BioPython
+ [FreeSASA](https://github.com/mittinatten/freesasa) 

(anyothers that you may find, please inform me to add)

#### WARNING

This code will generate large amounts of data, so be prepared to have to use 

#### Problems Still to Solve

+ The size of the outputs 
+ How to transform every virus PDB into a PDB that every chain is in different models
+ To test it for a big list of virus (which seems impossible with the size of the outputs)
