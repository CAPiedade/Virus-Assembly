# Virus Disassembly

Python2.7 Code designed to calculate the interactions of a T=1 Virus Capsid based on the group symmetry of the arrangement of the proteins.

This code allows to generate the different combinations of removing *N* proteins of a capsid based on the Icosahedral Group Symmetry.


#### Use

Run the code in the folder where your PDB file is.
The PDB file must have each chain in a different model for it to work.
